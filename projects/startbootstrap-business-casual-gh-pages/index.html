                    <p>Excerpt 1: I am able to stop my hand for a second, but I sadly cannot control it. It takes me hostage until the cycle is complete, and then releases me from its grasp. He holds down the paper as I start to fill it with separate lines. Lines layer and start to come together forming a chin and the smile that I can never forget as it scares me just as much as it scares him. 
“No.” He utters. “Why? Of all the people, why 540?” I finish with the eyes that stare into my soul, understanding my pain. My hand stops and shoots the pen across the room. 
	I sharply inhale. Silence spreads. Blinking back into control, I am afraid to say anything. They just look at me and I try to dodge eye contact. I’m the runt pig as the farmers look at me one last time before they send me off to chop off my head. I’ve lost the battle. Maxwell pulls the chair around next to me.
	“How do you know subject 540?” He whimpered. I try to say something, but my voice cracks. “How do you know?” His voice gets louder and he bangs his hand against the table.
	“I don’t know him. It means... I will.” </p>
                    <p>Excerpt 2: I see a figure of of the corner of my eye. I try to prevent hime from noticing me, but the pain is much to great. He’s studying the papers and the box is open. I don't remember opening the box. A slight worriedness escapes from his mouth. I try to sit up on the bed, yet the pain stops me mid-motion. He sees me now. He knows I’m awake. He looks up at me, It's Blackburn. He tries to keep his composure, yet his eyes are puffy and he says nothing to me.
“What do you want?” I say towards him. I sit there, waiting for an answer I am never going to receive. Those papers, I see, are my drawings. 
All of them.
 I have never seen them laid out in one place. He separated them into different categories: Murders, genocides, suicides, and just plain horrific, yet there was a small pile of papers that focused on. Some are my nightmares, that drew me awake to record them. Others, are something I never dealt with before. Most of what I see is of death and would leave sane person something to panic about, but truly, they are of someone I’ve never met. This person, with my name covered on his skin. 
He looks up at me, seeing the shocked look on my face as I stare at all of the drawings.
Some are on crumpled sheets; those are the ones I wanted to throw away, yet I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I don’t feel the pain anymore.
